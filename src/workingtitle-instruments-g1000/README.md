# Working Title G1000 NXi

This is the source code for the Working Title G1000 NXi avionics for MSFS.  To build it simply run:

    npm i && npm run build

This will compile the code and bundle up all the resources, putting the final output in the `dist` directory.  However, it does not create manifest or layout files -- these will need to be prepared by the user based on instructions and various tooling available online.
