# Working Title SR22T

This is the source code for the Working Title SR22T for MSFS.   To compile simply run:

    npm i && npm run build

Once compiled the final output will be in the `dist` directory.  However, this is not a full package that can be deployed in the sim, it only represents the Working Title modifications to the original Asobo TBM.
