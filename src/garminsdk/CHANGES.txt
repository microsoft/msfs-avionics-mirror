# Working Title Garmin SDK v0.1

These are the changes between the initial public release of the garminsdk and current release version 0.1.0.

## AHRS / ADC
* Added `AdcSystem` and moved ADC-related events to that.
* `AhrsSystem` now republishes relevant AHRS data to the bus under its own indexed topics for ease of consumption.
* `AhrsSystem` now publishes whether heading and altitude data are valid.
* Magnetometer failure no longer causes AHRS to fail, and a functioning magnetometer is no longer required for AHRS alignment.
* Updated horizon display and ASI to fully source data from `AhrsSystem` and `AdcSystem`.

## Map
* The map now draws all fallback flight path vectors and certain CF leg vectors as roll-heading vectors (arrows).
* Transitions that are part of leg-to-leg turns where one half of the turn joins a roll-heading vector are now fully drawn as roll-heading vectors.
* `MapOrientationRTRController` and map builder now support mapping orientation modes to subscribable target offsets/range endpoints in addition to static ones.
* Maps now render TOD/BOD markers where appropriate.
* Maps now correctly revert to heading-up under the hood when in track-up mode while on the ground.
* Fixed bug where map range compass layer could be missing heading labels after a map resize.
* Tweaked various map builder options to adjust to the new `TrafficSystem` interface.

## Traffic
* All Garmin traffic systems now implement the new interface `TrafficSystem`.
* Added more styling options to `TrafficMapRangeLayer`.
* `TrafficMapRangeLayer` will now always display ranges in nautical miles.
* Fixed a bug where `TrafficMapRangeLayer` would not draw ticks correctly after its parent map was resized.
* Fixed traffic offscale indications persisting after alert had been canceled.

## Autopilot
* Change default max bank angle in `GarminAPConfig` from 30 to 25.
* Instantiate the new `APBackCourseDirector` in `GarminAPConfig`.

## FMS
* Add vector anticipation protection for invalid legs.
* CF leg calc now respects a leg's lat/lon fields if they are defined.
* `GarminObsDirector` now always uses the magnetic variation at the OBS fix to compute a true course to track.
* Added new `ObsSuspDataProvider` class to handle SUSP mode.
* Set `vnavNextLegTargetAltitude` in `GarminVNavManager`.
* `GarminVNavManager` no longer requires `nextLeg`.
* Send active leg change after segments cleared to reset active leg in `NavDataComputer`.
* `FmaDisplaySlot` renamed to `FmaModeSlot` and its props were changed to make it more explicit that it requires the transition state of the active mode rather than the armed modes.
* `FmaApSlot` renamed to `FmaMasterSlot` and changed to handle just one master setting each.
* Enhanced `isDuplicateLeg` in FMS to handle when idents match but assciated airport is different.
* Moved various FMA components from g1000 to garminsdk.
* Don't show VNAV UNAVAILABLE message when beyond FAF.
* Fixed issue where deduping a CF after an intercept leg alters the flight path significantly.
* Fixed a bug with path rearm due to changes in LNAV sequencing.
* Fixed a bug where `addVisualFacilityFromLeg` would try to add discos to the repo.
* Fixed a bug that caused GS GP to not fully deactivate in some cases.
* Fixed issue that could cause direct-to with MANSEQ active to activate the next leg.

## Altimeter / Minimums
* Added support for NXi/G3000-style altimeter.
* Added `RadarAltimeterSystem`.
* Added `RadarAltimeter` component.
* `RadarAltimeterDataProvider` now smooths the provided radar altitude and provides a data failed state.
* Added `MinimumsAlerter`.
* Added a standard PFD minimums display component.

## Miscellaneous
* Added `WeatherRadar` component and `WeatherRadarUserSettingTypes` user setting type definition.
* Added support for properly updating flight plan state when using the travel-to feature.
* Added display of bush trip flight plans based on community feedback.
* Moved softkey framework from g1000 project to garminsdk.
* Moved some HSI components to garminsdk.
* Added `CdiScaleFormatter` class to generate text formatters for CDI scaling modes.
* Changed `UnitFormatter` output string for inches of mercury to 'IN'.
* TAS/TIS now correctly initialize to operating mode if starting flight in air.
* Fixed garmin visual approach legs not showing up in procedure previews
* Fixed various issues related to the display of bearing pointers and related info.
